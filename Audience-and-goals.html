						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
					</header>
						<p class="info">Defining the Design Challenge was the first step. I used the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit as a guide to posing questions to find the root problems of the website for users.</p>
						<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
						<p>The PCHS website needs to be able to reach more people locally and in state, be user-friendly, and be enjoyable to naviagte and read in order for them to recieve more funds and adoptions.</p>
						<h3>The Design Question:</h3>
							<p>How can the website receive more donations and interactions?</p>
						<h3>The Ultimate Impact</h3>
							<p>PCHS wants to provide homes for unwanted and stray pets, and they want to elminate suffering and overpolution through education. </p>
						<h3>Possible Solutions</h2>
							<p>Some solutions that could solve the probelms the website has would be simplifying the page, creating a unified theme, creating a better heirarchy, and making the call to action/mission simple and clear.</p>
						<h3>Context and Constraints</h3>
							<p>They have a local audience they are reaching in Pickens county, people ranging from all ages (kids as long as they have an adult to sign the papers). They are not getting enough donations and funds. They do actively use and update their website and Facebook account.</p>
						<h3>The Design Question Restated</h3>
							<p>How can the re-design of this website reach more people locally and in state, raise more donations and funds to stay open, and elimate suffering and overpopulation through the eduaction of spaying and neutering pets?</p>
