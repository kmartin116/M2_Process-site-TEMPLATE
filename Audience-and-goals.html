						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
					</header>
						<p class="info">After conducting preliminary research, I determined who the audiences were and the goals applicable to those audiences.</p>
                        <h1>Audience</h1>
                            <p> In order to find out who the target audience was, I used a sticky note method where I was able to recognize the groups of people and categorize them more specifiaclly into groups that related to each other.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion and Final Thoughts</h2>
                                    <p>The primary overarching goals of the Slow Food Upstate website redesign is to boost membership, clarify the organization's mission and provide events/event information for the public.</P>
                                    <p>Preliminary research of Slow Food Upstate - both primary and secondary - was much more helpful than I would have thought. This portion of the research was conducted before the interviews, so having a foundation of in-depth research about the organization really helped in defining goals and audiences.</p>
