						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
					</header>
						<p class="info">After conducting preliminary research, I determined who the audiences were and the goals applicable to those audiences.</p>
                        <h2>Audience</h2>
                            <p> In order to find out who the target audience was, I used a sticky note method where I was able to recognize the groups of people and categorize them more specifiaclly into groups that related to each other.</p>

                            <div class="image fit">
                                <img src= "images/IMG_2146.jpg" alt=""/> 
                            <p>To start off the process, I labeled the groups into Directly Involved, Peripherally Revelant, Fans, Skeptics, Need Help, and Give Help. Frrom there, I put sticky notes under them that seemed to relate to these categories.</p>
                            
                            <div class="image fit">
                                <img src= "images/IMG_2146 2.jpg" alt=""/> 
                            <p>Under the peripherally revelant category, I listed all of the groups they have interacted with in the commnuity and online.</p>
                            <div class="image fit">
                                <img src= "images/IMG_2147.jpg" alt=""/> 
                            <p>My next step was to rearrnage the groups in these categories into sub groups. These are horozonatlly aligned under the pink sticky notes. The sticky notes fally vertically fit under these sub groups. When doing this, I also moved around some of the sticky notes into a better fitting group. This helped me realize what the main groups in these categories were, allowing me to narrow down the target audience.</p>
                            <div class="image fit">
                                <img src= "images/IMG_2317.PNG" alt=""/> 
                            <p>Under peripherally relevant, I began to seperate them by businesses, social media, and the commnuity. Under the need help category, I divided them into groups of their intial help of pets, resocurces including items and money, and volunteers.</p>

                                    <p>The primary overarching goals of the Slow Food Upstate website redesign is to boost membership, clarify the organization's mission and provide events/event information for the public.</P>
                                    <p>Preliminary research of Slow Food Upstate - both primary and secondary - was much more helpful than I would have thought. This portion of the research was conducted before the interviews, so having a foundation of in-depth research about the organization really helped in defining goals and audiences.</p>
