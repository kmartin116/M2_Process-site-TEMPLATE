						<h1>Solution</h1>
					</header>
						<p class="info">After doing research, I was able to create a Call to Action to fulfill the goal of the website, and I was able to create a style tile that expresses the desired feel and tone of the website.</p>
					<h2>Call to Action</h2>
						<img src= "images/5A6B3CD5-2EBA-4B02-9E00-1C105507F338_1_105_c.jpeg" alt=""height="80%" width="80%"/> 
						<p>After doing my own research and interviewing with the manager at PCHS, I thought the best call to action would be buttons that allowed the viewer to donate, learn more about their goals behind spaying/neutering and who they are, and their social media outlet. After talking with the manager, she did tell me how their biggest need is donations/funds. They get a lot of physical items donated but they need monetary donations the most. Also, she said one of their biggest goals is educating their community, so I think having a call to action that helps the viewer learn more about spaying/neutering and how they can make a difference would be a good idea. The last possible CTA I made was a Facebook one, because they look like they are trying to build up their page and it would be a great way for viewers to get more involved and connected with the organization. 

						As for the colors, I think I want the background color of the website to be white, so making the call to actions a yellow or blue color would look nice. Theyâ€™ll stand out in these ranges of blues and yellows. </p>
					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
						<img src= "images/258E9F16-5746-444F-84A3-63D2089E2911_1_105_c.jpeg"alt=""height="80%" width="80%" padding-bottom=50% />
						<p>The adjectives I chose were progressive, educational, trusting, fun-loving, gentile, and communual. My ultiate goal with these adjectives describing the site is to make a place where every user feels as though they can trust and invest in PCHS.</p>
						<p>In supporting my adjectives, I chose a color scheme that was calming and hopeful. These colors are complimentary colors, and they go well together in emphasizing the needs of PCHS in a gentile and loving way. </p>
						<p>The typefaces I chose are Josefin Sans and Playfair Display. These two typeface pair well together and embody a feeling of professinalism that is still intersting anf fun. </p>
						<p>The elements I chose to use for my page are of course lots of cat and dog images, but I also wanted to incorporate the paws from the original website. After talking to the manager, I think incorporatig some detials from their website but in a new way will help keep the friendly atmosphere.</p>
						<p>The logo wasn't terrible to begin with, but I did want to simplify it more and take out the paws. I decided to go for a simple circle shape around the dog and cat silhoutte, adn lockup the name of the organization beside it. </p>
