					<h2>Primary Client Research</h2>
						<h3>Research from the Pickens County Humane Society website</h3>
							<p>The Pickens County Humane Society in 1972 opened as a 501(c)3 nonprofit, which is just a technical name for a charitable organization that doesn’t take any earnings for private shareholders or individual. They provide refuge for stray and unwanted pets, while also having a goal to eliminate suffering and overpopulation through education. Their goal isn’t to just help unwanted pets find good homes, but they want to insure that there will be less animals on the streets and overpopulated in the area from not getting spayed or neutered. Their adoption fees are $85 for all animals. This includes their de-worming, vaccinations, spay/neuter, feline leukemia test (cats), heart worm test (dogs); also, if supplies are available, it includes these as well: collar, harness, leash, toys, carrier (for cats) and a small bag of food. This website provides a lot of information about their services, who they are, how to get involved, and how to donate. </p>

						<h3>About Us</h3>
							<p>PCHS's mission is to “provide a refuge for stray and unwanted pets, to eliminate animal suffering and overpopulation through public education and to find the most suitable, forever home for each pet.” They want to help groe and provide resources for their community. On their About Us page, they also included some facts about their place including:
								<ul>
									<li>PCHS became a NO-Kill facility in 2014</li>
									<li>PCHS takes in 700-1,000 pets per year</li>
									<li>PCHS receives more "owner surrender" animals vs. "stray" animals</li>
									<li>PCHS is a NON-County operated facility and thrives only on donations</li>
									<li>PCHS animals are accepted with the goal to restore health, socialize, and find the most suitable adoptive home</li>
								</ul>
							They inlcue the names and roles of their team of administration, boards of directors, and their center programming at the bottom of the page. 
							</p>
						<h3>Events</h3>
							<p>Most of the events they host look local and team up with a business, like a golf tournament fundraiser and a Pancake Breakfast Pick-up @ The Grill on Valentine’s day. They also host an adopt-a-thon at tri-county tech and a yard sale/bake sale at their own building. These events raise money in order for them to provide services and stay running. 
								</p>
						<h3>Media</h3>
							<p>They are not too active on social media, besides their Facebook account. This isn’t that bad considering their a non-profit organization and not a business. However, with them lacking resources and money, it might be a good idea to broaden their accounts on other social media platforms in order to bring in more volunteers, more donations, and more customer/adopters. Their Facebook could use some tweaking and redesigning. Their posts look great; they post pretty regularly and they’re very friendly. However, their profile picture and cover photo are pets, not an official logo of their organization. The Facebook is lacking some professionalsim. These are some statistics of their Facebook page:
								<ul>
									<li>10,573 people have liked the page</li>
									<li>10,939 people follow the page</li>
									<li>275 check-ins</li>
									<li>Rated 4.7 out of 5, based on 146 reviews</li>
								</ul>

						<h3>Summary</h3>
							<p>From this primary client research, I was able to learn the history and mission behind Pickens County Humane Society, which is an important aspect of Human Centered Design. I also learned about the work they put in through their Facebook and in the events they host locally. Seeing how hard they work to keep their facility open, inspires me to work as hard as I can to redesign their website in the most effective way for them.</p>
						
					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
							<h3>Anderson County Humane Society</h3>
								<p>The ACHS is the same non-profit organziation as the PCHS. They are just located in Aderson County. They have the same goals of improving the quality of life of animals in the Anderson County Area. They try to accomplish this mission through various programs, activities, and events.</p>
								<p>
								When I originally was looking for websites of organization near me to redesign, I looked at this one, but their website didn’t look terrible to me. This website is actually pretty easy to navigate, has a great use of hierarchy and space, and has a consistent theme. It still isn’t the best example of great website, but it does look more professional and eye-catching than PCHS’s website. Their calendar of Events is a lot easer to read and look at. They have an actual calendar on the page that is interactive, where you hover over a date, and it tells you information about the event or fundraiser that day. From looking at this website, I’m able to understand how to better display information and unify the PCHS’s website. 
								</p>

							<h3>Best Friends Animal Society</h3>
								<p>Best Friends began in 1984 with a vision of creating a sanctuary for homeless and special-needs animals from the ground up, forging roadways and constructing buildings with their bare hands. Today, the sanctuary is still running and their national network partners and pet lifesaving centers have become hubs for innovation and inspiration. They bring easy lifesaving tactics to shelters and rescue groups across the US. They have their own magazine and a blog. Their impact page shows an impressive amount of impact this single organization has had in this country in reducing the number of animals being killed. </p>
								<p>
								While PCHS has similar goals in a sense of saving animals and educating the community, they are much more small-scale and centered on Pickens county. My goal wouldn’t be to completely make the PCHS website the same as this one in terms of who they reach and every media source they provide. However, I would love to create a flow/theme, a simple and unique logo, and a navbar like they have. Everything is so neat and easy to navigate while being fun and enjoyable. This is a great example of a good website design, so I will definitely be pulling inspiration from this one.

							<h3>Funds</h3>
								<p>When researching into what a 501(c)3 nonprofit is exactly, I learned how the organization can not take any of the funds they receive. Obviously, it's a non-profit, but part of me still thought that the people who worked here at PCHS would be getting some reimbursement. After learning that the people who make up PCHS are not being paid but are people who have full-time jobs and volunteer here, I understood why they didn’t have the resources to make a better website. They barely have enough funds to stay open and running, so they can’t exactly pay a designer to redesign their website for them. This helps put in perspective why the website looks the way it does now. The people under their programming team probably don’t have experience in design and are just doing the best they can to make it look cute and friendly. This also helps me understand better where all of their funds do go and exactly how the process works. Donations and fundraisers are going to be extremely important for them. </p>
								<p>
									<div class="image-fit">
										<img src= "images/501c3.jpeg" alt=""/> 
								My goal is to be able to help them earn more than enough funds to keep their organization running, for supplies, and for educational resources, so they don’t ever have to use their own money to keep it running or worry about not being able to help the animals in their community. 
									</p>
							<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>I was able to gather information that will be important for my design process and will help me see how important it is for the PCHS to have a better website. Not only am I able to understand better ways to design their website, but I'm able to understand why they don't have the funds or effort to necessarily have a great website already.</p>
						<h2>Interviews</h2>	
							<p>I was able to interview the manager over Pickens County Humane Society and two people who have adopted from PCHS as well. I had an interview with the manager over a phone call, and for the users I sent a survey to them over Facebook messenger. I had found they left reviews on the PCHS Facebook page and decided to reach out to them. </p>
							<h3>Client Interview</h3>
								<p>Megan Ragsdale has been working at Pickens County Humane Society for twenty years now. She has many roles such as overall manager, vet tech, social media manager, and website manager. As the vet tech, she is over animal testing and medications/prescrptions. Her favorite memory she has at PCHS is being able to raise enough money to remodel their kennel area two years ago.</p>
								<p>They do have a full satff that is paid, and the majority of people who are on satff are young adults. Their audience of people consists of a wide rage in age and gender. While their main clients and users are from Pickens county, they have people from other counties in SC and even in other states visit. Volunteers are always greatly apprecitaed here, but their biggest need is monetary donations.</p>
								<p>When PCHS started out in 1972, the mission was to provide refuge to unwanted pets and eliminate suffering. Their mission has always been the same, while their goals have expanded. They do beleive they are seeing a difference in their commuity through the impact of thier shelter. While they do not have a spay/neuter program set up yet, they are working towards it. Every animal that leaves is spayed/netuered.</p>
								<p>She would want viewers visitng their website to see it as user-friednly, easy to use and navigate, purposeful and has a story behind it, and educating and able to give others knoweldge. She wants the viewer to know their is a passion and message behind PCHS.</p>
								<P>Summary: From this interview, I was able to understand PCHS more personally and understand their goals more heartidly. They seem to have many goals they want to acheive in the nect few years. I want to build a website that allows them to reach for these goals and eventually acheive them. As the webiste manager, she noted she doesn't have a lot of time to put into the website with her other roles. With the shelter having a limited number of staff, the website seems to be ranked the least important, which is understanble. I hope to redesign the website in a way that conveys the same goals and message as before, includes aspects of the oringal website the people their love, and to make it more accesible for their needs. I want to create a CTA for donations, a page for education of spaying/neutering that talks about their goal of a future program, and just an overall easier website to navigate and use. Knowing that the audience can really be any age or gender in the commnuity, I want to make a website that is friendly and inviting for anyone. The website should attract more people and lead them to donate, adopt, get educated, and get invloved.</P>
							<h3>User Interview</h3>
								<p>Liz Bereswill and Leslie Winkler both have adopted from PCHS and are big supports of the shelter. Liz is a recent college, while Leslie is middle-aged mom. When asked to rate their experience with PCHS, they both rated it 5/5. When asked if they know anyone else who has adopted from them, one answered yes, while the other said no. They heard about the organzation through Facebook, online, and in the comunity. The reasons they chose to aspot with PCHS were that "the dogs were so cute and the staff were amazing," and they like to "help local businesses and organizations." Leslie said she has been a "supporter of their initiative for years."</p>
								<p>Summary: From surveying Leslie and Liz, I was able to understand more about their experience with Pickens County Humane Society. I was able to how people who have intereacted with them felt about them, and how they even heard about them. These two women are from different counties and differ in age, but were both able to have a great expierince, easy access to the site and social media, and fell in love with the people and program. I am able to take this information when considering the audience and how they view PCHS. I want to be able to build a website that continues to keep the experience great with the users and keep them supporting the organzaition.</p>
								<p>When asked if they wanted to include a picture of their pet they adopted from the shelter, they gladly shared one!</p>
