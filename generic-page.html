					<h2>Primary Client Research</h2>
						<h3>Research from the Pickens County Humane Society website</h3>
							<p>The Pickens County Humane Society in 1972 opened as a 501(c)3 nonprofit, which is just a technical name for a charitable organization that doesn’t take any earnings for private shareholders or individual. They provide refuge for stray and unwanted pets, while also having a goal to eliminate suffering and overpopulation through education. Their goal isn’t to just help unwanted pets find good homes, but they want to insure that there will be less animals on the streets and overpopulated in the area from not getting spayed or neutered. Their adoption fees are $85 for all animals. This includes their de-worming, vaccinations, spay/neuter, feline leukemia test (cats), heart worm test (dogs); also, if supplies are available, it includes these as well: collar, harness, leash, toys, carrier (for cats) and a small bag of food. This website provides a lot of information about their services, who they are, how to get involved, and how to donate. </p>
